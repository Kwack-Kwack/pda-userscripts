# pda-userscripts
A collection of PDA-compatible Userscripts. All of these have been tested and work in [Torn PDA](https://github.com/Manuito83/torn-pda).

They are grouped in various levels of completeness, from `functioning` (working in PDA) to `finished` (Code tidied, should work fine). I'll push updates to the git for any bugs/issues I stumble across.
