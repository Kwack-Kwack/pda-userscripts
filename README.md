# pda-userscripts

A collection of PDA-compatible Userscripts. All of these have been tested and work in [Torn PDA](https://github.com/Manuito83/torn-pda).

They are grouped in various levels of completeness, from `functioning` (barebones, working in PDA) to `finished` (Code tidied, should work fine). I'll push updates to the git for any bugs/issues I stumble across.

Most of the files are compiled from typescript files. If you'd like me to add the typescript files (for development) please let me know. Obviously note the typescript files will not work in PDA.
